Errors resolved in the Test Class : 
-----------------------------------
1. SignInTest : 
	Error occured :
		SignIn button is present inside iframe content, so without switch to it will not find the element and caused the test to fail.
	Fix :
		Added a line of code, driver.switchTo().frame(resource.getProperty("signin_framename"));.
2. FlightBookingTest : 
	Error Occured :
		There is no 'id' in the name of toTag, so it failed.
	Fix : 
		Found correct id for to, is ToTag instead of toTag and it works
3. HotelBookinTest : 
	Error Occured : 
		In the Page Object Model pattern, if we need to use FindBy annotation at field elements, it should be initialized but it was not initialized at anywhere inside the HotelBookingtest class.
	Fix : 
		After putting a single line , PageFactory.initElements(driver, this); before test method it will initialize the driver elements annotated with FindBy annotation, and it executes after it.

Code Refactors :
----------------
1. Created a new BaseTestConfiguration.java class which will help us to instantiate and initialize driver, browserplatform - Enccapsulation, Abstraction and Maintenance.
2. Instead of creating driver from test classes instead abstracted class called BaseTestConfiguration is used to return the created driver instance and launch the browserplatform.Maintenance will be increased in the way.
3. As implemented TDD pattern inside the codebase by creating testresources.properties which will be used provide the id,xpath values to the test class elements, helps readability and maintenance.		   
   No need to touch or modify the test classes if try to change the values.
4. Added support for other browsers other than Chrome such as IE, Firefox, Edge and Safari browsers. - Reusability and extensibility in OOPS principles
